= Trac2Github

Simple migration script from Trac to GitHub. The goal of this
software tool is to enable fast and transparent migration from
Trac issue tracking system to GitHub. Clone it from GitHub first:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:yegor256/trac2github.git
```

Make sure you have PHP 5.3+ installed
([how to install PHP?](http://php.net/manual/en/install.php)):

```
$ php -v
PHP 5.4.13 (cli) (built: Apr 10 2013 12:02:56)
Copyright (c) 1997-2013 The PHP Group
Zend Engine v2.4.0, Copyright (c) 1998-2013 Zend Technologies
```

Then, run the script and read its output for further instructions:

```
$ php trac2github.php
```
